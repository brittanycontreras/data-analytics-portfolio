# 📊 Analytics & Systems Projects

Below are selected projects focused on structural analysis, engagement modeling, and applied data science across health systems and digital platforms.

---
## 1. 🏈 Super Bowl LX Analysis
**Tools:** Python • Data Visualization • Notion
- A comprehensive analysis of Super Bowl LX (Seahawks vs Patriots) featuring:

### Key Insights:
- professional data visualizations using Python (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Interactive Notion workspace with multi-view databases
- Statistical analysis of game performance metrics

### Key Skills: Python, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Technical Documentation

## 2. 🏥 Healthcare Access & Outcome Disparities (California)

**Tools:** Python (pandas, seaborn, statsmodels), Census API, Jupyter, GitHub  

Multi-level analysis evaluating whether healthcare access and inpatient outcomes align with socioeconomic vulnerability across California.

This project compares:

- County-level inpatient mortality outcomes (statewide)
- ZIP-level healthcare facility density (Los Angeles County)

### Key Insights:

- Higher-poverty counties show modestly higher inpatient mortality rates.
- Median income is negatively associated with mortality.
- At the ZIP level, facility density per capita does not strongly track poverty burden.
- Disparities appear more clearly in outcomes than in infrastructure counts alone.

### Core Analyses:

- Census API integration (poverty rate, median income)
- Per-capita normalization of healthcare facilities
- OLS regression modeling with multicollinearity assessment
- Log transformation to correct skewed distributions
- Multi-level geographic modeling (county vs ZIP)

### Why It Matters:

Healthcare equity cannot be evaluated through facility counts alone. This analysis demonstrates that socioeconomic gradients are more visible in realized health outcomes than in raw infrastructure distribution, highlighting the complexity of measuring structural inequality.

## 3. 📱 TikTok Creator & Content Performance Analytics

**Tools:** Python (pandas, matplotlib), Jupyter / Colab, GitHub

Analysis of 1,000+ trending TikTok videos to understand what drives high-quality engagement, with a focus on comment behavior rather than views alone. This project simulates how a growth or platform analytics team might evaluate content health, engagement depth, and discussion signals on short-form video platforms.

**Key Insights:**

- Very short (0–15s) and medium (30–60s) videos generate the highest comment-to-like ratios

- Mid-length videos (15–30s) tend to drive more passive engagement

- Long videos are underrepresented among trending content, suggesting discoverability or retention constraints

**Core Analyses:**

- Custom engagement metrics (engagement rate, comment-to-like ratio)

- Video length segmentation and comparative analysis

- Identification of high-discussion outliers and engagement anomalies

- Visualization of engagement patterns across content formats

**Why It Matters:**
- This analysis highlights how optimizing for views alone can mask content that drives meaningful interaction. For creators and platform teams, comment-driven engagement offers a stronger signal of audience involvement and discussion-worthy content.

## 4. 🤖 Sentiment Analysis & Bias Detection in NLP Models
**Tools:** Python, TextBlob, VADER, LDA, Matplotlib

Analyzed systematic gender bias in sentiment analysis models by examining emotional tone patterns across character mentions in literary texts.

**Key Findings:**
- Measured quantifiable bias in emotional scoring across gendered characters
- Applied topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify thematic disparities
- Created visualizations documenting algorithmic fairness issues in NLP models

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization
- Algorithmic bias detection

- Analyzed linguistic patterns and gendered norms in online text data. 
Contributed to research design, analytical framing, and interpretation of results 
alongside a collaborative team.
