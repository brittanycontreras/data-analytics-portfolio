## 📊 Featured Projects
### 1. 📱 TikTok Creator & Content Performance Analytics

**Tools:** Python (pandas, matplotlib), Jupyter / Colab, GitHub

Analysis of 1,000+ trending TikTok videos to understand what drives high-quality engagement, with a focus on comment behavior rather than views alone. This project simulates how a growth or platform analytics team might evaluate content health, engagement depth, and discussion signals on short-form video platforms.

**Key Insights:**

- Very short (0–15s) and medium (30–60s) videos generate the highest comment-to-like ratios

- Mid-length videos (15–30s) tend to drive more passive engagement

- Long videos are underrepresented among trending content, suggesting discoverability or retention constraints

**Core Analyses:**

- Custom engagement metrics (engagement rate, comment-to-like ratio)

- Video length segmentation and comparative analysis

- Identification of high-discussion outliers and engagement anomalies

- Visualization of engagement patterns across content formats

**Why It Matters:**
- This analysis highlights how optimizing for views alone can mask content that drives meaningful interaction. For creators and platform teams, comment-driven engagement offers a stronger signal of audience involvement and discussion-worthy content.

### 2. 🤖 Sentiment Analysis & Bias Detection in NLP Models
**Tools:** Python, TextBlob, VADER, LDA, Matplotlib

Analyzed systematic gender bias in sentiment analysis models by examining emotional tone patterns across character mentions in literary texts.

**Key Findings:**
- Measured quantifiable bias in emotional scoring across gendered characters
- Applied topic modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify thematic disparities
- Created visualizations documenting algorithmic fairness issues in NLP models

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization
- Algorithmic bias detection
